Java implementation of Linear Optimization algorithms. The current implementation contains:
  * Primal Simplex
  * Dual Simplex
  * Two Phase Simplex
  * Integer Simplex (Using the Branch & Bound method)

At the moment I am to lazy to write documentation, see the JUnit Test-cases for usage of the algorithms.

Suggestions and comments are welcome. Therefore, don't hesitate!
